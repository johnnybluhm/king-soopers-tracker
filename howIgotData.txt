Api method was post https://www.kingsoopers.com/atlas/v1/purchase-history/details 
I got the body from the actual web page request at https://www.kingsoopers.com/mypurchases/detail/620~00055~2022-01-10~504~2232106


Thius endpont should be able to get the shit we need to make the requests to the other endpoints. Alot of data is sent via the cookie. They put
the header cookie: and the put all the request info in there sepeated by semi colons So we can
Maybe just sign in a user, then get their cookie and use that for awhile

need to log in to get cookies. Then need to serialize cookies, and put it in header for api. 
Then call https://www.kingsoopers.com/mypurchases/api/v1/receipt/summary/by-user-id to get the recepit ids that I can use to later get the 
order details from using the same cookie header as before.
